I would like to express my greatest gratitude to my advisor and chair of my committee, Dr. Juan Pablo Lewinger for his guidance and support throughout my Ph.D. Your wisdom helped me become a better researcher, better person. I would also like to thank my committee members, Dr. David Conti, Dr. Duncan Thomas, Dr. Meredith Franklin, and Dr. Joseph Hacia for the insights and advice. It was a great pleasure to work with you. 

I would like to thank all my friends during my time at USC, who shared many great moments with me.

Last but not least, my family especially my parents, thank you for your unconditional support and encouragement.
